# Overview
VanGo is a differential drive robot for drawing SVG images. To put it simply, 
VanGo is a wheeled mobile robot capable of trajectory tracking,
however the added feature is that the trajectory is generated from an SVG
image and the robot holds a marker which is brought into contact with the
page while the robot is on the desired path, thus drawing the SVG image.
